# Full stack project
Program made for the full stack project course of Helsinki University. A web app where you can view where images were taken on OpenStreetMap. Images can be uploaded when the user is logged in. Assumes images have GPS-location data embedded into them. 

App on heroku: https://images-on-map.herokuapp.com

Will take a while to start the container. Also the first query to backend will take a while because it starts the backend container.
